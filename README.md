# WeNads Frontend

WeNads is a Soulbound Token (SBT) collection with a unique twist: each wallet address is entitled to only one NFT. Breaking away from traditional SBT constraints, WeNads empowers you to customize your avatar's components whenever inspiration strikes! What sets us apart? Each component exists as a tradeable NFT, and here's what makes it special: you can design, mint, and market your own component templates, fostering a genuinely community-driven ecosystem. Best of all, every asset lives permanently on-chain!ðŸ”¥
